" vim: filetype=vifm :
" Sample configuration file for vifm (last updated: 27 Jun, 2013)
" You can edit this file by hand.
" The " character at the beginning of a line comments out the line.
" Blank lines are ignored.
" The basic format for each item is shown with an example.

" This is the actual command used to start vi.  The default is vim.
" If you would like to use another vi clone such Elvis or Vile
" you will need to change this setting.
set vicmd=vim

" Trash Directory
" The default is to move files that are deleted with dd or :d to
" the trash directory.  If you change this you will not be able to move
" files by deleting them and then using p to put the file in the new location.
" I recommend not changing this until you are familiar with vifm.
" This probably shouldn't be an option.
set trash

" This is how many directories to store in the directory history.
set history=100

" Follow links on l or Enter.
set followlinks

" With this option turned on you can run partially entered commands with
" unambiguous beginning using :! (e.g. :!Te instead of :!Terminal or :!Te<tab>).
set fastrun

" Natural sort of (version) numbers within text.
set sortnumbers

" Maximum number of changes that can be undone.
set undolevels=1024

" If you installed the vim.txt help file set vimhelp.
" If would rather use a plain text help file set novimhelp.
set novimhelp

" If you would like to run an executable file when you
" press return on the file name set this.
set norunexec

" More readible units
set noiec

" The FUSE_HOME directory will be used as a root dir for all FUSE mounts.
" Unless it exists with write/exec permissions set, vifm will attempt to
" create it.
set fusehome=/tmp/vifm_FUSE

" Format for displaying time in file list. For example:
" TIME_STAMP_FORMAT=%m/%d-%H:%M
" See man date or man strftime for details.
set timefmt=%m/%d\ %H:%M

" Show list of matches on tab complition in command-line mode
set wildmenu

" Ignore case in search patterns unless it contains at least one uppercase letter
" set ignorecase
" set smartcase

" Highlight search results automatically
set hlsearch

" Use increment searching (search while typing)
set incsearch

" Try to leave some space from cursor to upper/lower border in lists
set scrolloff=4

" Don't do to much requests to slow file systems
set slowfs=curlftpfs

" Set custom status line look
set statusline="  %t%= %A %10u:%-7g %15s %20d  "

" What should be saved automatically between vifm runs
" Like in previous versions of vifm
" set vifminfo=options,filetypes,commands,bookmarks,dhistory,state,cs
" Like in vi
set vifminfo=dhistory,savedirs,chistory,state,tui,shistory,phistory,fhistory,dirstack,registers,bookmarks

" FILETYPES
""""""""""""""""

" The file type is for the default programs to be used with
" a file extension.
" :filetype pattern1,pattern2 defaultprogram,program2
" :fileviewer pattern1,pattern2 consoleviewer
" The other programs for the file type can be accessed with the :file command
" The command macros %f, %F, %d, %F may be used in the commands.
" The %a macro is ignored.  To use a % you must put %%.

" For automated FUSE mounts, you must register an extension with :file[x]type
" in one of following formats:
"
" :filetype extensions FUSE_MOUNT|some_mount_command using %SOURCE_FILE and %DESTINATION_DIR variables
" %SOURCE_FILE and %DESTINATION_DIR are filled in by vifm at runtime.
" A sample line might look like this:
" :filetype *.zip,*.jar,*.war,*.ear FUSE_MOUNT|fuse-zip %SOURCE_FILE %DESTINATION_DIR
"
" :filetype extensions FUSE_MOUNT2|some_mount_command using %PARAM and %DESTINATION_DIR variables
" %PARAM and %DESTINATION_DIR are filled in by vifm at runtime.
" A sample line might look like this:
" :filetype *.ssh FUSE_MOUNT2|sshfs %PARAM %DESTINATION_DIR
" %PARAM value is filled from the first line of file (whole line).
" Example first line for SshMount filetype: root@127.0.0.1:/
"
" You can also add %CLEAR if you want to clear screen before running FUSE
" program.
